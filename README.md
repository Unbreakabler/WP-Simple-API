# WP-Simple-API
A simple API for wordpress

Very basic API built with Slim used to fetch posts/comments/user data as json

Used in conjuction with the ktwapp repository to quickly setup an ionic mobile application for *hopefully* any wordpress website 

I will likely be replacing this with https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/ in future projects.
